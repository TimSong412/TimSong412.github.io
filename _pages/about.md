I am a Master's student majoring in robotics at the GRASP Lab, University of Pennsylvania. I am conducting research under the supervision of Prof. Kostas Daniilidis, Prof. Lingjie Liu, and Jiahui Lei. Before that, I graduated from Zhejiang University and participated in several research projects of Prof. Xiaowei Zhou.
